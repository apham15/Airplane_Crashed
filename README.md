# Airplane_Crashed

At the time this Dataset was created in Kaggle (2016-09-09), the original version was hosted by Open Data by Socrata at the at: https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq, but unfortunately that is not available anymore. The dataset contains data of airplane accidents involving civil, commercial and military transport worldwide from 1908-09-17 to 2009-06-08.

## 1. Business Understanding
As a data scientist who loves to learn more about the dataset, I create a few question to ask myself the way I manipulate the data to bring up insightful information for business.

> 1. What is the fatalities rates? Does it tell us anything?
> 2. Any other realted variable that may impact on the airplane crashed?
> 3. How many planes were crashed yearly, monthly, weekly, and hour?
> 4. What is the interesting trend based on the raw dataset that business/ people would want to know?
> 5. Any suggestions based on the dataset?
> 6. Any machine learning algorithm that I can apply?

I found out that to be outstanding, I need to grind the dataset and do something that others never explore. Thanks to Kaggle, I can compare my work with others to find the better solutions.

I am very happy to say thank you and give a credit to https://www.kaggle.com/iamrohitsingh/flight-crash-investigation
